# Scalambda

![Cats Friendly Badge](https://typelevel.org/cats/img/cats-badge-tiny.png)

Deploying Lambda functions is time-consuming, so we built Scalambda to make it quick and easy. Using Scalambda, you can enable developers to easily build and deploy their own Lambda Functions (and/or ApiGateway instances) with little to no effort or knowledge of AWS required.

## Create a new Project

The easiest way to get started with Scalambda is via the Giter template. Run the following to get started immediately:

```
sbt --supershell=false new carpe/scalambda.g8
```

Check it out at https://github.com/carpe/scalambda.g8

## Add to an existing Project

Add the plugin to your project in the `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("io.carpe" % "sbt-scalambda" % "3.0.0")
```

## Motivation

Our motivations for Scalambda were:
- Make it so anybody can deploy an API to AWS with two or less steps
- Simplify configuration and optimization of Lambda Functions
- Speed up the time to market of new projects by providing as many sensible defaults as we could
- Give developers as much freedom as possible so they can be free to experiment with new ideas

Scalambda started as an internal-only project over a year ago. Over the course of its lifetime it has received a TON of feedback and refinement from several of our teams and friends. Thanks to their efforts, we think we've managed to land on a solution that is an incredibly powerful tool.

## What is it?

Scalambda itself is composed of three separate libraries. Each of them can be used independently depending on your project's use case and your team's toolchain. 

- `sbt-scalambda` An SBT plugin that should help you to deploy your lambdas, managing libraries, logging and much more.

- `scalambda-core` A traditional library that provides utilities for writing Scala-based Lambda Functions

- `scalambda-testing` A set of test helpers for testing Lambda Functions

## (Short-term) Roadmap

Top priority is continue to create more documentation as well as add some example projects to help people get their Lambda Functions deployed even quicker.
