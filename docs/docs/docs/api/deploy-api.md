This section assumes you have already defined your API, [read this to learn how](https://carpe.github.io/scalambda/docs/api/create-api/).

## Deploying your API

Since all the configuration for your API is inside your `build.sbt` file, follow the same steps for deploying a Scalambda project that uses Api Gateway as you would with one that doesn't.

##### Step 1: Generate the Terraform module

Use the `scalambdaTerraform` SBT task to generate a Terraform module for your API.

##### Step 2: Add the new Terraform module

Either in your existing Terraform, or in a new `.tf` file, add the following module: 

```hcl
# my-project/terraform/main.tf

module "helloworld_api" {
  # Points to the terraform generated by scalambda inside the your project's target folder
  source = "<path to your project>/target/terraform" 
}
```

##### Step 3: Apply the Terraform

Run the following commands in your favorite shell (make sure you have Terraform installed):

```bash
# cd to wherever your terraform is
cd my-project/terraform

# initialize the terraform (only need to this once)
terraform init

# apply the terraform
terraform apply

```
