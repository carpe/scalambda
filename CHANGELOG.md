## [2.0.0] - 2019-07-18
## Added
- Ability to add Billing Tags to created resources via `billingTags` setting key and `BillingTag` function.
- New Lambda Function Alias resources will be created to ensure that Api Gateway Deployments always point to function versions that exist. This fixes the issue that caused outages between Api Deployments.
- Api Gateway Deployments will be automatically managed by Terraform. No more `terraform taint` commands!
- Lambda Function versions will be exposed as terraform module outputs.  

## Changed
- Custom Domain Name terraform resource now points to the active stage, rather than the intermediate stage. This insures that X-Ray traces show up properly.
